    <img class="recipeimage" src="../images/broccoli-soup.webp" alt="Broccoli Soup">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love this creamy, tasty recipe that is truly vegan. Stir in coconut milk and nutmeg for an additional rich, nutty flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup raw cashews</li>
        <li>5 cups vegetable broth, divided</li>
        <li>2 Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups coarsely chopped broccoli</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend cashews and 1 cup vegetable broth in a blender until smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining 4 cups vegetable broth into a large pot; add potatoes and onion. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in broccoli and basil; return to a simmer. Cover and cook until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir cashew mixture into soup; add salt and black pepper. Bring to a simmer and immediately remove from heat. Transfer about half the soup to a blender; blend until smooth. Return blended soup to pot and stir well. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
